## C - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

In this project, I learned about what and how to use pointers and arrays and the differences between the two, as well as how to use and manipulate strings in C.

### Header File `file_folder/main.h`

- `main.h`: Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the project.

### Files and Prototypes

File | Prototype
---- | ---------
0-reset_to_98.c | `void reset_to_98(int *n);`
1-swap.c | `void swap_int(int *a, int *b);`
2-strlen.c | `int _strlen(char *s);`
3-puts.c | `void _puts(char *str);`
4-print_rev.c | `void print_rev(char *s);`
5-rev_string.c | `void rev_string(char *s);`
6-puts2.c | `void puts2(char *str);`
7-puts_half.c | `void puts_half(char *str);`
8-print_array.c | `void print_array(int *a, int n);`
9-strcpy.c | `char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);`
100-atoi.c | `int _atoi(char *s);`
101-keygen.c | C program that generates random valid passwords for the program `101-crackme`.
