# C - Variables, if, else, while

In this project, we will explore various tasks involving variables, if-else statements, and while loops in the C programming language.

## Task List

0. **Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
   - File: `0-positive_or_negative.c`
   - Description: This C program generates a random number and determines whether it is positive or negative.
   - Requirements:
     - The program should print the randomly generated number followed by:
       - "is positive" if the number is greater than 0.
       - "is zero" if the number is equal to 0.
       - "is negative" if the number is less than 0.

1. **The last digit**
   - File: `1-last_digit.c`
   - Description: This C program prints the last digit of a randomly generated number.
   - Requirements:
     - The program should print the phrase "Last digit of [number] is [last_digit]", followed by:
       - "and is greater than 5" if the last digit is greater than 5.
       - "and is 0" if the last digit is 0.
       - "and is less than 6 and not 0" if the last digit is less than 6 and not 0.

2. **I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
   - File: `2-print_alphabet.c`
   - Description: This C program prints the lowercase alphabet using the `putchar` function only twice.

3. **alphABET**
   - File: `3-print_alphabets.c`
   - Description: This C program prints the lowercase alphabet except for the letters 'q' and 'e' using the `putchar` function only twice.

4. **When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
   - File: `4-print_alphabt.c`
   - Description: This C program prints the lowercase alphabet followed by the uppercase alphabet using the `putchar` function only three times.

5. **Numbers**
   - File: `5-print_numbers.c`
   - Description: This C program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.

6. **Numberz**
   - File: `6-print_numberz.c`
   - Description: This C program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0 using the `putchar` function only twice, without any variables of type char.

7. **Smile in the mirror**
   - File: `7-print_tebahpla.c`
   - Description: This C program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order using the `putchar` function only twice.

8. **Hexadecimal**
   - File: `8-print_base16.c`
   - Description: This C program prints all numbers of base 16 (hexadecimal) in lowercase using the `putchar` function only three times.

9. **Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**
    - File: `9-print_comb.c`
    - Description: This C program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers in ascending order using the `putchar` function only four times, without any variables of type char. The numbers should be separated by commas and spaces.

10. **Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need**
    - File: `100-print_comb3.c`
    - Description: This C program prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order using the `putchar` function only five times, without any variables of type char. The combinations should be separated by commas and spaces.

11. **The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...**
    - File: `101-print_comb4.c`
    - Description: This C program prints all possible different combinations of three digits in ascending order using the `putchar` function only six times, without any variables of type char. The combinations should be separated by commas and spaces.

12. **Software is eating the World**
    - File: `102-print_comb5.c`
    - Description: This C program prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers in ascending order using the `putchar` function only eight times, without any variables of type char. The combinations should be separated by commas and spaces.

Each task corresponds to a C file with a specific name and contains the necessary code to accomplish the given requirements.
