# 0x03-debugging

Debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs (defects or problems that prevent correct operation) within a computer program, software, or system. Debugging tactics can involve interactive debugging, control flow analysis, unit testing, integration testing, log file analysis, monitoring at the application or system level, memory dumps, and profiling.

## Debugging
Project tasks done during ALX SE programme. It aims to learn how to debug in the C language.

### Technologies

- C files are compiled using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- C files are written according to the C90 standard
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

### Files

All of the following files are programs written in C:

- `0-main.c` - Test that function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of 0
- `1-main.c` - Fixed program to resolve the infinite loop
- `2-largest_number.c` - Prints the largest of three integers
- `3-print_remaining_days.c` - Converts a date to the day of the year and determines how many days are left in the year
- `main.h` - Header file
