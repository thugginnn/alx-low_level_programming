# C - Preprocessor

In this project, I learned about common predefined macros in C while practicing implementing my own and include-guarding header files.

## Tasks

### 0. Object-like Macro

- File: `0-object_like_macro.h`
- Description: Header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`.

### 1. Pi

- File: `1-pi.h`
- Description: Header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.

### 2. File name

- File: `2-main.c`
- Description: C program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from followed by a new line.

### 3. Function-like macro

- File: `3-function_like_macro.h`
- Description: Header file that defines a function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.

### 4. SUM

- File: `4-sum.h`
- Description: Header file that defines a function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
